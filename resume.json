As Front End Lead for one such project, VitalDB, Nahuel produced quality web pages exhibiting both pixel perfection and intuitive design. Furthermore, Nahuel contributed the project's title and custom-designed logo. My key takeaway from working with Nahuel is that he is receptive, reliable and amiable. His amicability makes him a prime choice for team ventures, and his outstanding diligence allows him to produce innovative and detail-oriented results. As a passionate software engineer, he is constantly learning new technologies and hungry for unique challenges. Nahuel is imaginative and pleasant to work with, and I highly recommend him for any project requiring a dependable teammate and gratifying results."

I partnered with Nahuel on a multi day project while we were students together at App Academy and he was definitely one of my favorite partners! He was always so present with the work and was always willing to share and listen to ideas. So many of our bugs were solved with a combination of Nahuel's creative, out of the box thinking and his relentless tenacity. I like that he is always willing to do what it takes to get the job done and it was inspiring to collaborate with someone that goes the extra mile to solve a problem. Throughout our work together I cannot remember a single time Nahuel lost his temper or let his frustration get the best of him! If I were on a team I know that I would feel more comfortable and confident knowing that Nahuel was part of that team as well!"
